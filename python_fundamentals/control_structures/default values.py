From python docs:
Important warning: The default value is evaluated only once. 
This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary or instances of most classes.
For example, the following function accumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:
If you donâ€™t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this instead:

def f(a, L=None):

    L.append(a)
    return L


print(f(1)) # [1]
print(f(2)) # [2]
print(f(3)) # [3]
