  <property>
    <name>javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL</name>
    <value>jdbc:postgresql://postgres-hms:5432/metastore</value>
    <description>
      JDBC connect string for a JDBC metastore.
      To use SSL to encrypt/authenticate the connection, provide database-specific SSL flag in the
      connection URL.
      For example, jdbc:postgresql://s/db?ssl=true for postgres database.

    <name>metastore.execute.setugi</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>
      In unsecure mode, setting this property to true will cause the metastore to execute DFS operations using 
      the client's reported user and group permissions. Note that this property must be set on 
      both the client and server sides. Further note that its best effort. 
      If client sets its to true and server sets it to false, client setting will be ignored.

      <property>
    <name>metastore.disallow.incompatible.col.type.changes</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>
      If true, ALTER TABLE operations which change the type of a
      column (say STRING) to an incompatible type (say MAP) are disallowed.
      RCFile default SerDe (ColumnarSerDe) serializes the values in such a way that the
      datatypes can be converted from string to any type. The map is also serialized as
      a string, which can be read as a string as well. However, with any binary
      serialization, this is not true. Blocking the ALTER TABLE prevents ClassCastExceptions
      when subsequently trying to access old partitions.
      
      Primitive types like INT, STRING, BIGINT, etc., are compatible with each other and are
      not blocked.
      
      See HIVE-4409 for more details.
