"""
Arrays and lists
Array, fixed lenght
list, dinamically store, some types
Will do with some types on only one type

What I define it is not an array, even tho I set type hint as integer
I did not make any validation on the passed value
And it can  grow dinamically, so more of a concept of a list, not array

TODO: double linked list AND Circular linked list AND some ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION
